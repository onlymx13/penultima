      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penultima">Penultima</a> is a game of inductive logic played on a chessboard.
      It's similar to a cross between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_(card_game)">Mao</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">chess</a>.
      Each player is assigned a role, either Spectator or Player. There are always two Players, and everyone else is a Spectator.
      At the beginning of the game, the Spectators create rules in secret to decide how the pieces move, capture, or interact.
      Spectators have their own private chat visible to all other Spectators, but not to the Players. They use it to discuss the rules and their interactions during the game.
      Pieces may also be assigned a rule that takes effect when the piece is <i>invoked</i>, which is like a special ability that the piece can use instead of moving.
      Players take turns attempting to move or invoke a piece, and the Spectators tell them whether their move was legal, undoing it if necessary.
      At that point, play may pass to the other Player, or the original Player may continue, depending on house rules.
      Victory occurs by checkmate.
      In this implementation of the game, currently very little is enforced. It is up to the Players and Spectators to enforce rules accurately. Think of this as a chessboard sandbox.
